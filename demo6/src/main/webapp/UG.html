    <h2>        Undergraduate education is education conducted after secondary education and before postgraduate education.
        It typically includes all postsecondary programs up to the level of a bachelor's degree.
        For example, in the United States, an entry-level university student is known as an undergraduate,
        while students of higher degrees are known as graduate students.</h2>
       <h2> Upon completion of a number of required and elective courses as part of an undergraduate program, the student would earn the corresponding degree.
        (In some regions, individual "courses" and the "program" collection are given other terms, such as "units" and "course", respectively.)
        In some other educational systems, undergraduate education is postsecondary education up to the level of a master's degree;
        this is the case for some science courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.</h2>
