  <p>
    Department of Mechanical Engineering at Rathinam Technical Campus (RTC) is established in 2011 and is offering an
    undergraduate program in Mechanical Engineering with 30 seats. Rathinam Technical Campus was approved by Anna University,
    Chennai, and Affiliated to AICTE, New Delhi.
  </p>
<p>
  As the college is located in Industrial City, Mechanical Students are enriched with more practical knowledge,
  which makes them achieve Core Placements. With a Mechanical background, one can shine in different fields like Design,
  Production, Robotics, Aeronautical, Space Research, Marine, Automobile, etc. The Department Faculty and students have
  published more papers in National and International Conferences/Journals. The major areas of research include Biodiesel,
  Solar Energy, Composite materials, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Energy-Efficient Technologies, Digital Manufacturing,
  Robotics, Supply Chain Management, and Lean Manufacturing. Our department has very good infrastructure and well-equipped
  laboratories. The Department has conventional and research laboratories. Other than the Anna University Curriculum,
  we have a Product Application center (iLensys – Solar panel installation training center, Godrej Lab, and Robotics
  Laboratory which helps the students to acquire practical knowledge in core engineering subjects.
</p>
  <p>
    Our Department has organized National conferences, workshops,s, and Faculty Development Program funded by various funding
    agencies. We have conducted workshops on Home appliances using the Product application center (iLensys) and Godrej lab for
    school, Polytechnic, and Engineering Students. The Department has established an Industrial collaborative training center
    which is providing training and services in the field of precision manufacturing. Larsen and Toubro & Godrej provide hands-on
    training that helps the students to become entrepreneurs. Our department has signed many MOUs to train students in various
    streams of Mechanical Engineering and also that helps the students for Internship, Project, and Placement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our Students Participated in National Level conferences/ Workshops in various institutions and secured awards and Prizes.
    Our department encourages students to participate in various sports activities, and students have won many awards and medals.
