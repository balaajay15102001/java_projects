  <p>Well, pet parents often believe that catching and fetching things is an instinct among puppies. Though bringing and
    chasing down is natural with certain breeds, catching is not. So, if your puff is not trying to catch the tennis balls
    you toss for him, there is nothing to worry about. All he needs is some encouragement to learn catching. Check out the
    article here to understand how to teach a dog to see.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>At what age do dogs learn to catch?</h2>
  <p>
    Knowing what might be the right time for your puff to learn catching is essential. It would help if you did not start
    teaching your dog to catch very early. A pup with age 10 weeks or younger can't spot things that easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    Preferably after 10 weeks or so, you can participate in games that involve spotting treats and later fetching them.
    Once you find them good at this stuff, you can start to train your dog for catching. Ideally, the training can be
    withdrawn at the age of 16 weeks or so.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Why my dog cant catch a treat?</h2>
  <p>Before we try to find the answer, the very first thing we should consider is that all dog breeds do not excel when
    it comes to catching something. The brachycephalic dogs with short heads and noses find it way more challenging to
    catch than other breeds. Thus, breeds such as pugs, boxers, bulldogs, Pekingese, and Boston terrier will require a
    lot of motivation when it comes to catching.</p>
  <p>
    Also, as it goes without saying, a dog with mobility and visionary complications can't participate in catching
    activities. Even slight arthritis can make catching difficult for your furry friend. Therefore, if you have been
    trying to teach your dog to catch for quite some time now and things do not work well, seeing your vet might be the
    best option.
  </p>
  <h2>Let's start with recognizing</h2>
  <p>
    Grabbing a treat or an object out of nowhere may confuse your pup in the very first place. So, before you start
    tossing something for your dog to catch, offer enough exposure to the treat.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Teach Retrieving</h2>
  <p>Teaching your dog to retrieve treats as you throw them away is the third phase of learning catching tricks.
    Usually, if your puppy sits and stares at most of the activities you pursue around him, then making him used
    to fetching things is essential.</p>
